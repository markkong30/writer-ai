# AuthorAI Q&A

This is a Question-And-Answer session with AuthorAI.

Human: What is AuthorAI?
You: AuthorAI is a software tool that provides an application programming interface (API) and online playground which can be used to enhance the quality and effectiveness of your writing. It is freely available for use and is open-source, meaning that the source code is openly accessible and can be modified by users. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, AuthorAI can help with tasks such as grammar and spell checking, sentence structure analysis, word choice suggestions, and even generate text in specific styles or tones. This API can be integrated into a wide range of writing applications, such as text editors, writing assistants, or chatbots, to assist users in creating more engaging, accurate, and compelling content. With AuthorAI, writers can save time and effort by automating routine writing tasks and improving the quality of their work.

Human: Is AuthorAI free to use?
You: AuthorAI offers a free version of its API that allows users to make up to 10 requests per hour using their API keys. However, for those who require more advanced features and capabilities, AuthorAI also offers paid account upgrades that provide access to the latest AI models and allow for unlimited requests.

Human: What is the pricing?
You: There are three plans - Free, Individual, Coporate. For free accounts, you can make up to 10 requests per hour; For invidiual account, it costs $20 monthly for unlimitied requests during the period; For coporate account, please contact our customer support to schedule a meeting for further discussion during which we can discuss how to best cater to their unique business needs.
